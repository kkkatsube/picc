# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a fresh repository named "picc" that appears to be in the initial setup phase. The repository contains only basic files:
- Empty README.md (just contains "# picc")
- MIT License
- .gitignore configured for Laravel/PHP projects

## Current State

The repository is currently empty of source code but shows preparation for a PHP/Laravel project based on the .gitignore patterns that include:
- Laravel-specific paths (storage/, bootstrap/compiled.php, public/storage, etc.)
- PHP dependencies (/vendor/, composer.json patterns)
- Environment files (.env, .env.backup, .env.production)
- PHP testing artifacts (.phpunit.result.cache)

## Development Commands

No build, test, or lint commands are currently available as the project has not been initialized with a framework or build system yet.

## Architecture

No source code architecture exists yet. This appears to be a greenfield project awaiting initial development.
